# Instructions

You have been hired to update a 90's music fanpage by an eccentric millionaire. (Don't ask why. It just is.) Below are some of the deliverables the client has asked for. The HTML page is already linked to the CSS and JavaScript files, so you are ready to start coding.

After you make a change to one of the files, click the green `run` button at the top of the page. This will reload all the files (with your changes) and display them in the right side `result` pane.

You can view the full-size webpage in a new tab by clicking the box with the arrow coming out of it next to the url bar in the `result` pane. *If you have opened the pane in a new tab, you will need to refresh that tab every time you run the changes.*

#### HTML
- [ ] switch the order of two HTML elements
- [ ] change the type an HTML tag (e.g. make a \<p\> an \<h3\>)
  - remember to update both the opening and closing html tags
  - inspect the page in the developers console after you have edited it
- [ ] find an image of a discman and add it above #band-list
- [ ] [embed a video for each artist](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_youtube.asp)
  - make sure to us the correct video id when embedding
- [ ] add a new section for your favorite 80's bands, including photos, bios and links
- [ ] *ADVANCED* create a navbar or dropdown menu that uses [anchor links](https://docs.helpscout.com/article/220-anchor-links) to link to each individual artist


#### CSS
- [ ] give all <p> text a special font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
  - like your CSS page, you will need to include a link tag to tell your HTML page to load this font
- [ ] pick a better background color or better yet, a [background image](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-image.asp) or a [background gradient](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_gradients.asp)
  - you can make a gradient [here](https://uigradients.com/#Superman), [here](https://www.css-gradient.com/) or [here](https://mycolor.space/gradient)
- [ ] change the color of the <li> elements
- [ ] change some of the [border properties](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_border.asp)
- [ ] *ADVANCED* make your discman image (from the HTML section) [spin](http://arevisual.com/blog/how-to-rotate-an-image-in-3d-with-css-animation/)


#### JavaScript (Advanced)
- [ ] manually remove the html inside #band-list and use JavaScript to insert the band info
  - start by adding the name of each band in the bands array as an <li> inside #band-list
  - next try adding the band name and the image
- [ ] add a button that displays an [alert](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_alert.asp) message of `Jam time!` [on click](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_eventlistener.asp)
- [ ] *SUPER ADVANCED* add a button that you can click which will toggle between displaying an 80's band list and a 90's band list
  - it may be helpful to make a global variable to store the decade that changes every time the button is clicked
  - change the discman image (from the HTML section) to a walkman image for the 80s
